@article{altmanMixedHiddenMarkov2007a,
	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a useful tool for capturing the behavior of overdispersed, autocorrelated data. These models have been applied to many different problems, including speech recognition, precipitation modeling, and gene finding and profiling. Typically, HMMs are applied to individual stochastic processes; HMMs for simultaneously modeling multiple processes---as in the longitudinal data setting---have not been widely studied. In this article I present a new class of models, mixed HMMs (MHMMs), where I use both covariates and random effects to capture differences among processes. I define the models using the framework of generalized linear mixed models and discuss their interpretation. I then provide algorithms for parameter estimation and illustrate the properties of the estimators via a simulation study. Finally, to demonstrate the practical uses of MHMMs, I provide an application to data on lesion counts in multiple sclerosis patients. I show that my model, while parsimonious, can describe the heterogeneity among such patients.},

@article{ancoli-israelRoleActigraphyStudy2003,
	abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

@article{bartolucciDiscreteLatentVariable2022,
	abstract = {We review the discrete latent variable approach, which is very popular in statistics and related fields. It allows us to formulate interpretable and flexible models that can be used to analyze complex datasets in the presence of articulated dependence structures among variables. Specific models including discrete latent variables are illustrated, such as finite mixture, latent class, hidden Markov, and stochastic block models. Algorithms for maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation of these models are reviewed, focusing, in particular, on the expectation--maximization algorithm and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method with data augmentation. Model selection, particularly concerning the number of support points of the latent distribution, is discussed. The approach is illustrated by summarizing applications available in the literature; a brief review of the main software packages to handle discrete latent variable models is also provided. Finally, some possible developments in this literature are suggested.},

@article{bartolucciLikelihoodInferenceClass2006,
	abstract = {Summary             For a class of latent Markov models for discrete variables having a longitudinal structure, we introduce an approach for formulating and testing linear hypotheses on the transition probabilities of the latent process. For the maximum likelihood estimation of a latent Markov model under hypotheses of this type, we outline an EM algorithm that is based on well-known recursions in the hidden Markov literature. We also show that, under certain assumptions, the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for testing a linear hypothesis on the transition probabilities of a latent Markov model, against a less stringent linear hypothesis on the transition probabilities of the same model, is of χ¯2 type. As a particular case, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic between a latent class model and its latent Markov version, which may be used to test the hypothesis of absence of transition between latent states. The approach is illustrated through a series of simulations and two applications, the first of which is based on educational testing data that have been collected within the National Assessment of Educational Progress 1996, and the second on data, concerning the use of marijuana, which have been collected within the National Youth Survey 1976--1980.},

@article{bieganskiUnificationCommonActigraphic2021,
	abstract = {Actigraphy is a well-known, inexpensive method to investigate human movement patterns. Sleep and circadian rhythm studies are among the most popular applications of actigraphy. In this study, we investigate seven common sleep-wake scoring algorithms designed for actigraphic data, namely Cole-Kripke algorithm, two versions of Sadeh algorithm, Sazonov algorithm, Webster algorithm, UCSD algorithm and Scripps Clinic algorithm. We propose a unified mathematical framework describing five of them. One of the observed novelties is that five of these algorithms are in fact equivalent to low-pass FIR filters with very similar characteristics. We also provide explanations about the role of some factors defining these algorithms, as none were given by their Authors who followed empirical procedures. Proposed framework provides a robust mathematical description of discussed algorithms, which for the first time allows one to fully understand their operation and basics.},

@article{blumeNparACTPackageFree2016,
	abstract = {For many studies, participants' sleep-wake patterns are monitored and recorded prior to, during and following an experimental or clinical intervention using actigraphy, i.e. the recording of data generated by movements. Often, these data are merely inspected visually without computation of descriptive parameters, in part due to the lack of user-friendly software. To address this deficit, we developed a package for R Core Team [6], that allows computing several non-parametric measures from actigraphy data. Specifically, it computes the interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) of activity and gives the start times and average activity values of M10 (i.e. the ten hours with maximal activity) and L5 (i.e. the five hours with least activity). Two functions compute these 'classical' parameters and handle either single or multiple files. Two other functions additionally allow computing an L-value (i.e. the least activity value) for a user-defined time span termed 'Lflex' value. A plotting option is included in all functions. The package can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archives Network (CRAN). *The package 'nparACT' for R serves the non-parametric analysis of actigraphy data.*Computed parameters include interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) as well as start times and average activity during the 10~h with maximal and the 5~h with minimal activity (i.e. M10 and L5).},

@article{Boselli1998,
	abstract = {EEG arousals were quantified in 40 nocturnal polysomnographic recordings belonging to four age groups (teenagers: 10 to 19 years; young adults: 20 to 39 years; middle-aged: 40 to 59 years; elderly: {$>$} or = 60 years). Ten subjects (five males and five females) participated in each group. The subjects were healthy and sound sleepers. All sleep recordings were preceded by an adaptation night which aimed at excluding the presence of sleep-related disorders. The recordings were carried out in a partially soundproof recording chamber and in a standard laboratory setting. Arousal indices (AI), defined as the number of arousals per hour of sleep, were calculated for total sleep time (AI/TST) and for all the sleep stages. AI/TST increased linearly with age (r = 0.852; p {$<$} 0.00001): teenagers (13.8), young adults (14.7), middle-aged (17.8), elderly (27.1). An age-related positive linear correlation was found also for the arousal indices referred to NREM sleep (r = 0.811; p {$<$} 0.00001) and to stages 1 and 2 (r = 0.712; p {$<$} 0.00001), while in stages 3 and 4 and in REM sleep, arousal indices showed stable values across the ages. Overall, arousals lasted 14.9 +/- 2.3 seconds, with arousal duration stable across the ages (range of means: 13.3-16.6 seconds) and no relevant differences between NREM sleep (14.6 +/- 2.5 seconds) and REM sleep (16.2 +/- 5 seconds). The paper discusses the impact of age on arousals, the similarities between arousals and the phases d'activation transitoire, and the consideration that arousals are physiological components of sleep.},

@article{buiPolicyRecognitionAbstract2002,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for recognising an    agent's behaviour in dynamic, noisy, uncertain domains, and across    multiple levels of abstraction.  We term this problem on-line plan    recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic    inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the    agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold.  In terms    of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov    Model (AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its    dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of    this network.  We then describe an application of the    Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to    construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this model.  In    terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition    framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model.  The    Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the    independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution, leading    to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales    well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy.  This    illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be    complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited, can lead    to efficient plan recognition algorithms.  We demonstrate the    usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in    a complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance    data.},

@article{chuCorrelatingTwoContinuous2005,
	abstract = {Summary             In individuals who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), distributions of quantitative HIV ribonucleic acid measurements may be highly left censored with an extra spike below the limit of detection LD of the assay. A two-component mixture model with the lower component entirely supported on [0, LD] is recommended to model the extra spike in univariate analysis better. Let LD1 and LD2 be the limits of detection for the two HIV viral load measurements. When estimating the correlation coefficient between two different measures of viral load obtained from each of a sample of patients, a bivariate Gaussian mixture model is recommended to model the extra spike on [0, LD1] and [0, LD2] better when the proportion below LD is incompatible with the left-hand tail of a bivariate Gaussian distribution. When the proportion of both variables falling below LD is very large, the parameters of the lower component may not be estimable since almost all observations from the lower component are falling below LD. A partial solution is to assume that the lower component's entire support is on [0, LD1]×[0, LD2]. Maximum likelihood is used to estimate the parameters of the lower and higher components. To evaluate whether there is a lower component, we apply a Monte Carlo approach to assess the p-value of the likelihood ratio test and two information criteria: a bootstrap-based information criterion and a cross-validation-based information criterion. We provide simulation results to evaluate the performance and compare it with two ad hoc estimators and a single-component bivariate Gaussian likelihood estimator. These methods are applied to the data from a cohort study of HIV-infected men in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the data from the Women's Interagency HIV oral study. These results emphasize the need for caution when estimating correlation coefficients from data with a large proportion of non-detectable values when the proportion below LD is incompatible with the left-hand tail of a bivariate Gaussian distribution.},

@article{Dinesh2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical behavior researchers using motion sensors often use acceleration summaries to visualize, clean, and interpret data. Such output is dependent on device specifications (e.g., dynamic range, sampling rate) and/or are proprietary, which invalidate cross-study comparison of findings when using different devices. This limits flexibility in selecting devices to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. PURPOSE: Develop an open-source, universal acceleration summary metric that accounts for discrepancies in raw data among research and consumer devices. METHODS: We used signal processing techniques to generate a Monitor-Independent Movement Summary unit (MIMS-unit) optimized to capture normal human motion. Methodological steps included raw signal harmonization to eliminate inter-device variability (e.g., dynamic g-range, sampling rate), bandpass filtering (0.2-5.0 Hz) to eliminate non-human movement, and signal aggregation to reduce data to simplify visualization and summarization. We examined the consistency of MIMS-units using orbital shaker testing on eight accelerometers with varying dynamic range ($\pm$2 to $\pm$8 g) and sampling rates (20-100 Hz), and human data (N = 60) from an ActiGraph GT9X. RESULTS: During shaker testing, MIMS-units yielded lower between-device coefficient of variations than proprietary ActiGraph and ENMO acceleration summaries. Unlike the widely used ActiGraph activity counts, MIMS-units were sensitive in detecting subtle wrist movements during sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Open-source MIMS-units may provide a means to summarize high-resolution raw data in a device-independent manner, thereby increasing standardization of data cleaning and analytical procedures to estimate selected attributes of physical behavior across studies.},

@article{etindele2022,
	abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) has an unrecognized influence on behavioral risk factors as well as public health strategies related to sleep health disparities. In addition to that, objectively measuring SES' influence on sleep health is challenging. A systematic review of polysomnography (PSG) studies investigating the relation between SES and sleep health disparities is worthy of interest and holds potential for future studies and recommendations. A literature search in databases was conducted following Prisma guidelines. Search strategy identified seven studies fitting within the inclusion criteria. They were all cross-sectional studies with only adults. Except for one study conducted in India, all of these studies took place in western countries. Overall emerging trends are: (1) low SES with its indicators (income, education, occupation and employment) are negatively associated with PSG parameters and (2) environmental factors (outside noise, room temperature and health worries); sex/gender and BMI were the main moderators of the relation between socioeconomic indicators and the variation of sleep recording with PSG. Socioeconomic inequalities in sleep health can be measured objectively. It will be worthy to examine the SES of participants and patients before they undergo PSG investigation. PSG studies should always collect socioeconomic data to discover important connections between SES and PSG. It will be interesting to compare PSG data of people from different SES in longitudinal studies and analyze the intensity of variations through time.},

@article{gaoDilemmaAnalyzingPhysical2021,
	abstract = {Physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity and sedentary behavior) have been the focus among many researchers in the biomedical and behavioral science fields. The recent shift from hip- to wrist-worn accelerometers in these fields has signaled the need to develop novel approaches to process raw acceleration data of physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the best practices for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data to accurately predict individuals' energy expenditure and the times spent in different intensities of free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior. To this end, accurately analyzing and interpreting wrist-worn accelerometer data has become a major challenge facing many clinicians and researchers. In response, this paper attempts to review different methodologies for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data and offer cutting edge, yet appropriate analysis plans for wrist-worn accelerometer data in the assessment of physical behavior. In this paper, we first discuss the fundamentals of wrist-worn accelerometer data, followed by various methods of processing these data (e.g., cut points, steps per minute, machine learning), and then we discuss the opportunities, challenges, and directions for future studies in this area of inquiry. This is the most comprehensive review paper to date regarding the analysis and interpretation of free-living physical activity data derived from wrist-worn accelerometers, aiming to help establish a blueprint for processing wrist-derived accelerometer data.},

Yet, as these models become more complex and challenging to understand, it is important to consider what pitfalls these methods have and what opportunities there are for future research to address these pitfalls.                                                     In this paper, we review five lesser known pitfalls one can encounter when using HMMs or their extensions to solve ecological problems: (a) violation of the snapshot property in continuous‐time HMMs; (b) biased inference from hierarchical HMMs when applied to temporally misaligned processes; (c) sensitive inference from using random effects to partially pool across heterogeneous individuals; (d) computational burden when using HMMs to approximate models with continuous state spaces; and (e) difficulty linking the hidden process to space or environment.                                                     This review is for ecologists and ecological statisticians familiar with HMMs, but who may be less aware of the problems that arise in more specialised applications. We demonstrate how each pitfall arises, by simulation or example, and discuss why this pitfall is important to consider. Along with identifying the problems, we highlight potential research opportunities and offer ideas that may help alleviate these pitfalls.                                                     Each of the methods we review are solutions to current ecological research problems. We intend for this paper to heighten awareness of the pitfalls ecologists may encounter when applying these more advanced methods, but we also hope that by highlighting future research opportunities, we can inspire ecological statisticians to weaken these pitfalls and provide improved methods.},

We conducted in-home sleep study of 40 healthy adults (17 female/23 male; age 26.7~$\pm$~12.1~years), assessing sleep variables both by Motionlogger{\textregistered} Micro Watch Actigraphy (MMWA) and Zmachine{\textregistered} Insight+ electroencephalography (EEG). Data of MMWA were separately scored per 30~sec epochs by each of the four popular IAs, and data of the Zmachine were also scored per 30~sec epochs by its proprietary IA. In reference to the EEG Zmachine method, all four of the MMWA algorithms showed high (\textasciitilde 94 to 98\%) sensitivity and moderate (\textasciitilde 42 to 54\%) specificity in detecting Sleep epochs. All of them significantly underestimated Sleep Onset Latency (SOL: \textasciitilde 9 to 20~min), and all of them, except the Sadeh IA, significantly underestimated Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO: \textasciitilde 22 to 25~min) and overestimated Total Sleep Time (TST: \textasciitilde 32 to 45~min) and Sleep Efficiency (SE: \textasciitilde 7 to 9\%). The Sadeh IA showed significantly smaller bias than the other three IAs in deriving WASO, TST, and SE. Overall, application of 'Rescoring Rules' improved performance of the Cole-Kripke IA. The Sadeh and Rescored Cole-Kripke IAs exhibited highest agreement with the EEG Zmachine method (Cohen's Kappa: \textasciitilde 51\%), while the UCSD IA exhibited lowest agreement (Cohen's kappa: \textasciitilde 47\%). However, minimum detectable change across all sleep parameters was smallest with use of the UCSD IA and, except for SOL, largest with use of the Sadeh algorithm. Findings of this study indicate the Sadeh IA is most appropriate for deriving sleep parameters of healthy adults, while the UCSD IA is most appropriate for evaluating change in sleep parameters over time or in response to medical intervention.},

@article{imtiaz2021,
	abstract = {Designing wearable systems for sleep detection and staging is extremely challenging due to the numerous constraints associated with sensing, usability, accuracy, and regulatory requirements. Several researchers have explored the use of signals from a subset of sensors that are used in polysomnography (PSG), whereas others have demonstrated the feasibility of using alternative sensing modalities. In this paper, a systematic review of the different sensing modalities that have been used for wearable sleep staging is presented. Based on a review of 90 papers, 13 different sensing modalities are identified. Each sensing modality is explored to identify signals that can be obtained from it, the sleep stages that can be reliably identified, the classification accuracy of systems and methods using the sensing modality, as well as the usability constraints of the sensor in a wearable system. It concludes that the two most common sensing modalities in use are those based on electroencephalography (EEG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). EEG-based systems are the most accurate, with EEG being the only sensing modality capable of identifying all the stages of sleep. PPG-based systems are much simpler to use and better suited for wearable monitoring but are unable to identify all the sleep stages.},

We apply the model to a unique longitudinal study of teen driving where risky driving behavior and the occurrence of crashes or near crashes are measured prospectively over the first 18 months of licensure. Of scientific interest is relating the two processes and predicting crash and near crash outcomes. We propose a two-state mixed hidden Markov model whereby the hidden state characterizes the mean for the joint longitudinal crash/near crash outcomes and elevated g-force events which are a proxy for risky driving. Heterogeneity is introduced in both the conditional model for the count outcomes and the hidden process using a shared random effect. An estimation procedure is presented using the forward--backward algorithm along with adaptive Gaussian quadrature to perform numerical integration. The estimation procedure readily yields hidden state probabilities as well as providing for a broad class of predictors.},

	abstract = {The development of consumer sleep-tracking technologies has outpaced the scientific evaluation of their accuracy. In this study, five consumer sleep-tracking devices, research-grade actigraphy, and polysomnography were used simultaneously to monitor the overnight sleep of fifty-three young adults in the lab for one night. Biases and limits of agreement were assessed to determine how sleep stage estimates for each device and research-grade actigraphy differed from polysomnography-derived measures. Every device, except the Garmin Vivosmart, was able to estimate total sleep time comparably to research-grade actigraphy. All devices overestimated nights with shorter wake times and underestimated nights with longer wake times. For light sleep, absolute bias was low for the Fitbit Inspire and Fitbit Versa. The Withings Mat and Garmin Vivosmart overestimated shorter light sleep and underestimated longer light sleep. The Oura Ring underestimated light sleep of any duration. For deep sleep, bias was low for the Withings Mat and Garmin Vivosmart while other devices overestimated shorter and underestimated longer times. For REM sleep, bias was low for all devices. Taken together, these results suggest that proportional bias patterns in consumer sleep-tracking technologies are prevalent and could have important implications for their overall accuracy.},

	abstract = {Abstract             MOTIVATION: Hidden Markov models can efficiently and automatically build statistical representations of related sequences. Unfortunately, training sets are frequently biased toward one subgroup of sequences, leading to an insufficiently general model. This work evaluates sequence weighting methods based on the maximum-discrimination idea. RESULTS: One good method scales sequence weights by an exponential that ranges between 0.1 for the best scoring sequence and 1.0 for the worst. Experiments with a curated data set show that while training with one or two sequences performed worse than single-sequence Probabilistic Smith-Waterman, training with five or ten sequences reduced errors by 20\% and 51\%, respectively. This new version of the SAM HMM suite outperforms HMMer (17\% reduction over PSW for 10 training sequences), Meta-MEME (28\% reduction), and unweighted SAM (31\% reduction).

@article{lerouxOrganizingAnalyzingActivity2019,
	abstract = {The NHANES study contains objectively measured physical activity data collected using hip-worn accelerometers from multiple cohorts. However, using the accelerometry data has proven daunting because: 1) currently, there are no agreed upon standard protocols for data storage and analysis; 2) data exhibit heterogeneous patterns of missingness due to varying degrees of adherence to wear-time protocols; 3) sampling weights need to be carefully adjusted and accounted for in individual analyses; 4) there is a lack of reproducible software that transforms the data from its published format into analytic form; and 5) the high dimensional nature of accelerometry data complicates analyses. Here, we provide a framework for processing, storing, and analyzing the NHANES accelerometry data for the 2003--2004 and 2005--2006 surveys. We also provide an NHANES data package in R, to help disseminate high quality, processed activity data combined with mortality and demographic information. Thus, we provide the tools to transition from ``available data online'' to ``easily accessible and usable data'', which substantially reduces the large upfront costs of initiating studies of association between physical activity and human health outcomes using NHANES. We apply these tools in an analysis showing that accelerometry features have the potential to predict 5-year all cause mortality better than known risk factors such as age, cigarette smoking, and various comorbidities.},

@article{Li2020,
	abstract = {Actigraphy is widely used in sleep studies but lacks a universal unsupervised algorithm for sleep/wake identification. An unsupervised algorithm is useful in large-scale population studies and in cases where polysomnography (PSG) is unavailable, as it does not require sleep outcome labels to train the model but utilizes information solely contained in actigraphy to learn sleep and wake characteristics and separate the two states. In this study, we proposed a machine learning unsupervised algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sleep/wake identification. The proposed algorithm is also an individualized approach that takes into account individual variabilities and analyzes each individual actigraphy profile separately to infer sleep and wake states. We used Actiwatch and PSG data from 43 individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis study to evaluate the method performance. Epoch-by-epoch comparisons and sleep variable comparisons were made between our algorithm, the unsupervised algorithm embedded in the Actiwatch software (AS), and the pre-trained supervised UCSD algorithm. Using PSG as the reference, the accuracy was 85.7\% for HMM, 84.7\% for AS, and 85.0\% for UCSD. The sensitivity was 99.3\%, 99.7\%, and 98.9\% for HMM, AS, and UCSD, respectively, and the specificity was 36.4\%, 30.0\%, and 31.7\%, respectively. The Kappa statistic was 0.446 for HMM, 0.399 for AS, and 0.311 for UCSD, suggesting fair to moderate agreement between PSG and actigraphy. The Bland--Altman plots further show that the total sleep time, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency estimates by HMM were closer to PSG with narrower 95\% limits of agreement than AS and UCSD. All three methods tend to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared to PSG. Our HMM approach is also able to differentiate relatively active and sedentary individuals by quantifying variabilities in activity counts: individuals with higher estimated activity variabilities tend to show more frequent sedentary behaviors. Our unsupervised data-driven HMM algorithm achieved better performance than the commonly used Actiwatch software algorithm and the pre-trained UCSD algorithm. HMM can help expand the application of actigraphy in cases where PSG is hard to acquire and supervised methods cannot be trained. In addition, the estimated HMM parameters can characterize individual activity patterns and sedentary tendencies that can be further utilized in downstream analysis.},

	abstract = {Polysomnography (PSG) is the ``gold standard'' for monitoring sleep. Alternatives to PSG are of interest for clinical, research, and personal use. Wrist-worn actigraph devices have been utilized in research settings for measures of sleep for over two decades. Whether sleep measures from commercially available devices are similarly valid is unknown. We sought to determine the validity of five wearable devices: Basis Health Tracker, Misfit Shine, Fitbit Flex, Withings Pulse O2, and a research-based actigraph, Actiwatch Spectrum. We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to assess differences between devices relative to PSG and correlational analysis to assess the strength of the relationship. Data loss was greatest for Fitbit and Misfit. For all devices, we found no difference and strong correlation of total sleep time with PSG. Sleep efficiency differed from PSG for Withings, Misfit, Fitbit, and Basis, while Actiwatch mean values did not differ from that of PSG. Only mean values of sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) from Actiwatch correlated with PSG, yet this correlation was weak. Light sleep time differed from PSG (nREM1 + nREM2) for all devices. Measures of Deep sleep time did not differ from PSG (SWS + REM) for Basis. These results reveal the current strengths and limitations in sleep estimates produced by personal health monitoring devices and point to a need for future development.},

@article{maruottiMixedNonHomogeneous2012,
	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are frequently used to analyse longitudinal data, where the same set of subjects is repeatedly observed over time. In this context, several sources of heterogeneity may arise at individual and/or time level, which affect the hidden process, that is, the transition probabilities between the hidden states. In this paper, we propose the use of a finite mixture of non‐homogeneous HMMs (NH‐HMMs) to face the heterogeneity problem. The non‐homogeneity of the model allows us to take into account observed sources of heterogeneity by means of a proper set of covariates, time and/or individual dependent, explaining the variations in the transition probabilities. Moreover, we handle the unobserved sources of heterogeneity at the individual level, due to, for example, omitted covariates, by introducing a random term with a discrete distribution. The resulting model is a finite mixture of NH‐HMM that can be used to classify individuals according to their dynamic behaviour or to estimate a mixed NH‐HMM without any assumption regarding the distribution of the random term following the non‐parametric maximum likelihood approach. We test the effectiveness of the proposal through a simulation study and an application to real data on alcohol abuse. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract                                                                Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that include individual‐level random effects have recently been promoted for inferring animal movement behaviour from biotelemetry data. These `mixed HMMs' come at significant cost in terms of implementation and computation, and discrete random effects have been advocated as a practical alternative to more computationally intensive continuous random effects. However, the performance of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adoption, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective.                                                     I performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process of a two‐state HMM. I focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, which often consist of relatively long time series (30--250 observations per animal) for relatively few individuals (5--100 animals).                                                     I generally found mixed HMMs did not improve state assignment relative to standard HMMs. Reliable estimation of random effects required larger sample sizes than are often feasible in telemetry studies. Continuous random effect models performed reasonably well with data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa. Random effects accounting for unexplained individual variation can improve estimation of state transition probabilities and measurable covariate effects, but discrete random effects can be a relatively poor (and potentially misleading) approximation for continuous variation.                                                     When weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs, three important considerations are study objectives, sample size and model complexity. HMM applications often focus on state assignment with little emphasis on heterogeneity in state transition probabilities, in which case random effects in the hidden state process simply may not be worth the additional effort. However, if explaining variation in state transition probabilities is a primary objective and sufficient explanatory covariates are not available, then random effects are worth pursuing as a more parsimonious alternative to individual fixed effects.                                                     To help put my findings in context and illustrate some potential challenges that practitioners may encounter when applying mixed HMMs, I revisit a previous analysis of long‐finned pilot whale biotelemetry data.},

While movement HMMs typically rely solely on location data (e.g. step length and turning angle), auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily‐available resources for incorporating much more ecological and behavioural realism. However, complex movement or observation process models often necessitate custom and computationally demanding HMM model‐fitting techniques that are impractical for most practitioners, and there is a paucity of generalized user‐friendly software available for implementing multivariate HMMs of animal movement.                                                                          Here, we introduce an open‐source                     R                     package,                     momentuHMM                     , that addresses many of the deficiencies in existing HMM software. Features include: (1) data pre‐processing and visualization; (2) user‐specified probability distributions for an unlimited number of data streams and latent behaviour states; (3) biased and correlated random walk movement models, including dynamic ``activity centres'' associated with attractive or repulsive forces; (4) user‐specified design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters using formulas familiar to most R users; (5) multiple imputation methods that account for measurement error and temporally irregular or missing data; (6) seamless integration of spatio‐temporal covariate raster data; (7)                     cosinor                     and spline models for cyclical and other complicated patterns; (8) model checking and selection; and (9) simulation.                                                                                             After providing an overview of the main features of the package, we demonstrate some of the capabilities of                     momentuHMM                     using real‐world examples. These include models for cyclical movement patterns of African elephants, foraging trips of northern fur seals, loggerhead turtle movements relative to ocean surface currents, and grey seal movements among three activity centres.                                                                                             momentuHMM                     considerably extends the capabilities of existing HMM software while accounting for common challenges associated with telemetry data. It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis‐driven animal movement analyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non‐statisticians. While motivated by telemetry data, the package can be used for analysing any type of data that is amenable to HMMs. Practitioners interested in additional features are encouraged to contact the authors.},

@article{michelotHmmTMBHiddenMarkov2022,
	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely applied in studies where a discrete-valued process of interest is observed indirectly. They have for example been used to model behaviour from human and animal tracking data, disease status from medical data, and financial market volatility from stock prices. The model has two main sets of parameters: transition probabilities, which drive the latent state process, and observation parameters, which characterise the state-dependent distributions of observed variables. One particularly useful extension of HMMs is the inclusion of covariates on those parameters, to investigate the drivers of state transitions or to implement Markov-switching regression models. We present the new R package hmmTMB for HMM analyses, with flexible covariate models in both the hidden state and observation parameters. In particular, non-linear effects are implemented using penalised splines, including multiple univariate and multivariate splines, with automatic smoothness selection. The package allows for various random effect formulations (including random intercepts and slopes), to capture between-group heterogeneity. hmmTMB can be applied to multivariate observations, and it accommodates various types of response data, including continuous (bounded or not), discrete, and binary variables. Parameter constraints can be used to implement non-standard dependence structures, such as semi-Markov, higher-order Markov, and autoregressive models. Here, we summarise the relevant statistical methodology, we describe the structure of the package, and we present an example analysis of animal tracking data to showcase the workflow of the package.},

	abstract = {Summary                                                                Due to the substantial progress in tracking technology, recent years have seen an explosion in the amount of movement data being collected. This has led to a huge demand for statistical tools that allow ecologists to draw meaningful inference from large tracking data sets.                                                     The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods.                                                                          The                     R                     package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model.                                                                                             We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis                     Haggis scoticus                     . Our findings illustrate the role our software, and movement modelling in general, can play in conservation and management by illuminating environmental constraints.},

@article{potterCircadianRhythmSleep2016,
	abstract = {Abstract             Circadian (∼24-hour) timing systems pervade all kingdoms of life and temporally optimize behavior and physiology in humans. Relatively recent changes to our environments, such as the introduction of artificial lighting, can disorganize the circadian system, from the level of the molecular clocks that regulate the timing of cellular activities to the level of synchronization between our daily cycles of behavior and the solar day. Sleep/wake cycles are intertwined with the circadian system, and global trends indicate that these, too, are increasingly subject to disruption. A large proportion of the world's population is at increased risk of environmentally driven circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, and a minority of individuals are also genetically predisposed to circadian misalignment and sleep disorders. The consequences of disruption to the circadian system and sleep are profound and include myriad metabolic ramifications, some of which may be compounded by adverse effects on dietary choices. If not addressed, the deleterious effects of such disruption will continue to cause widespread health problems; therefore, implementation of the numerous behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that can help restore circadian system alignment and enhance sleep will be important.},

@article{Su2022,
	abstract = {We aimed to provide objectively measured sleep parameters across lifespan by sex and race in a national representative sample of US population. The study included 11,279 participants 6~years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011--2014, who had at least 3~days of valid sleep parameters calculated from 7-day 24-h accelerometer recording. Sleep duration showed a U-shaped association with age and reached the minimum at age 40 and started to increase again around age 50. The clock time for sleep onset (CTSO) delayed with age and reached the maximum at about age 20. CTSO then advanced until age 50, leveled off until age 70, then advanced again after age 70. Sleep efficiency showed an overall decreasing trend across the lifespan but stabilized from age 30 to about age 60. US young adults in age 20~s are the ones who slept at the latest around midnight, while the middle aged US residents between 40 and 50~years old slept the least. Females generally present longer sleep duration than males, while more likely to have later sleep onset, particularly at older ages. Non-Hispanic Blacks showed worse sleep characteristics, i.e. sleep later, sleep shorter, and sleep less efficiently, compared to other racial groups.

@article{toDifferencesPhysicalActivity2022,
	abstract = {This study investigates differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days, and its associations with sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics in the U.S population using the NHANES 2011--2014 data. Physical activity was measured using ActiGraph GT3X+. Raw acceleration data were converted to Monitor-Independent Movement Summary units (MIMS-units) that account for inter-device variability and eliminates non-human movement. The daily MIMS-units were averaged for weekdays and weekend days. Demographic characteristics were self-reported. Height and weight were objectively measured. The sample included 6611 adults aged~≥~20~years and 3520 children aged between 6 and 19~years. The results show that more MIMS-units were registered on weekdays compared to weekend days for adults (652, 95\%CI~=~533, 770) and children (889, 95\%CI~=~702, 1076). Factors associated with physical activity in adults (gender, age, marital status, ethnicity, education level, and weight status) were similar for weekdays and weekend days. In children, physical activity was associated with ethnicity, weight status, and age. The level of differences in physical activity between weekdays and weekend days among adults was larger for men, Hispanic Americans, and those with lower education levels. Differences among children were similar across subgroups, except for those aged 16--19~years who had smaller level of difference compared to those aged 12--15~years. In conclusion, adults and children were more active on weekdays than weekend days. The effects of structured days (i.e., weekdays) on physical activity appeared to be similar across most child subgroups but more heterogeneous for adult subgroups. Interventions increasing physical activity opportunities during weekend days are warranted.},

@article{websterActivityBasedSleepMonitor1982,
	abstract = {Wrist activity measured with a piezoceramic transducer was digitized and analyzed together with subjects' sleep/wake status to derive an optimal method for automatic computer sleep/wake scoring. Several algorithms for quantifying periods of activity were considered, and an algorithm that summed changes in activity level over a 2-s interval was found most sensitive. A computer program for scoring sleep/wake from the resulting digital activity records was then developed, and parameters derived by comparison with subjects' sleep/wake status as determined by EEG. EEG and activity sleep/wake scores agreed 94.46\% of the time. A further prospective test of the automatic scoring system with new data yielded agreement of96.02\%. Finally, the data collection and recording functions were implemented in a wearable microprocessor-based digital activity monitor. The automatic scoring program was adjusted to use activity data collected by this monitor, and agreed 93.88\% with EEG scoring. A prospective test with new data agreed 93.04\% with EEG. Automatic scoring of activity data for sleep/wake is not only fast and accurate, but allows sleep to be monitored in non-laboratory situations. In addition, the score is objective and reliable, and free of scorer bias and drift.},

	abstract = {To examine whether rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters can predict all-cause, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality in a general adult population of the US. We further compared the mortality predictive performance of these parameters with that of traditional risk factors. This study included 7,252 adults from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2011--2014, who had wrist accelerometer data obtained at baseline and follow-up status linked to the National Death Index records (2011--2019). During a median of 81~months (interquartile range, 69--94~months) of follow-up, 674 (9.3\%) deaths occurred. There were inverse associations between relative amplitude (RA) and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality with increased quartiles RA associated with lower mortality risk (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The Hazard Ratios ranged from 0.61 to 0.79. Furthermore, RA outperformed all the tested traditional predictors of all-cause mortality with the exception of age. This study suggests that participants with blunted rest-activity circadian rhythms had a higher risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality. Future studies will be needed to test whether interventions that regulate rest-activity circadian activity rhythms will improve health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Impaired rest--activity circadian rhythm has been associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Animals with mutations in clock genes display accelerated aging and shortened life span. Whether impaired rest--activity circadian rhythm is also associated with processes of aging in humans has not been explored. We analyzed accelerometry and physiological data from 7 539 adults participating in the 2011--2014 waves of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We used accelerometry data to compute rest--activity rhythm measurements. We used physiological data to compute measurements of biological aging according to 3 published algorithms: Klemera--Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation (HD). In the models adjusting multiple covariates, participants with higher relative amplitude (RA) and interdaily stability (IS) and lower intradaily variability (IV) exhibited less advanced biological aging indexed by KDM and PhenoAge (effect sizes for 1-quantile increase in these rest--activity measurements ranged from 0.54 to 0.57 ``years'' for RA, 0.24 to 0.28 ``years'' for IS, and 0.24 to 0.35 ``years'' for IV, ps \&lt; .001). Similar finding was observed for biological aging indexed by HD, but the significance was limited to RA with 1-quantile increase in RA associated with 0.09 log units decrease in HD (p \&lt; .001). The results indicate that blunted rest--activity circadian rhythm is associated with accelerated aging in the general population, suggesting that interventions aiming at enhancing circadian rhythm may be a novel approach for the extension of a healthy life span.},

@article{xuRestactivityCircadianRhythm2022,
	abstract = {Introduction Circadian rhythm disturbance occurs in type 2 diabetes, yet it is unknown whether it also exists in the prediagnostic phase of the disease. Thus, we examined the association of rest-activity circadian rhythm with 2-hour glucose levels and the risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a nationally representative sample of adults without diabetes using a cross-sectional design. Research design and methods We analyzed data from 2760 adults without diabetes (age ≥20) with at least 4 days of validated accelerometer recordings and a valid oral glucose tolerance test from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011--2014. Non-parametric rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters were derived from the accelerometer recordings. Results In the models adjusting for multiple covariates, a one-quantile increase in relative amplitude (ie, increased circadian rhythmicity) was associated with 2.66 mg/dL decrease in 2-hour glucose level (95\% CI −3.94 to −1.38, p{$<$}0.001) and a decreased odds of IGT (OR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.89, p=0.002). A one-quantile increase in intradaily variability (ie, increased rhythm fragmentation) was associated with 3.01 mg/dL increase in 2-hour glucose level (95\% CI 1.52 to 4.49, p=0.001) and an increased odds of IGT (OR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.58, p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Circadian disruption is significantly associated with impaired glucose homeostasis in a general population of adults without diabetes. The association of circadian rhythm abnormalities with indicators of the pre-diabetic state suggests that circadian dysfunction may contribute to early disease pathogenesis.},
