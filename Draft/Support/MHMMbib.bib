	abstract = {Abstract                                                                Hidden Markov models (HMMs) that include individual‐level random effects have recently been promoted for inferring animal movement behaviour from biotelemetry data. These `mixed HMMs' come at significant cost in terms of implementation and computation, and discrete random effects have been advocated as a practical alternative to more computationally intensive continuous random effects. However, the performance of mixed HMMs has not yet been sufficiently explored to justify their widespread adoption, and there is currently little guidance for practitioners weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs for a particular research objective.                                                     I performed an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of a suite of fixed and random effect models for individual heterogeneity in the hidden state process of a two‐state HMM. I focused on sampling scenarios more typical of telemetry studies, which often consist of relatively long time series (30--250 observations per animal) for relatively few individuals (5--100 animals).                                                     I generally found mixed HMMs did not improve state assignment relative to standard HMMs. Reliable estimation of random effects required larger sample sizes than are often feasible in telemetry studies. Continuous random effect models performed reasonably well with data generated under discrete random effects, but not vice versa. Random effects accounting for unexplained individual variation can improve estimation of state transition probabilities and measurable covariate effects, but discrete random effects can be a relatively poor (and potentially misleading) approximation for continuous variation.                                                     When weighing the costs and benefits of mixed HMMs, three important considerations are study objectives, sample size and model complexity. HMM applications often focus on state assignment with little emphasis on heterogeneity in state transition probabilities, in which case random effects in the hidden state process simply may not be worth the additional effort. However, if explaining variation in state transition probabilities is a primary objective and sufficient explanatory covariates are not available, then random effects are worth pursuing as a more parsimonious alternative to individual fixed effects.                                                     To help put my findings in context and illustrate some potential challenges that practitioners may encounter when applying mixed HMMs, I revisit a previous analysis of long‐finned pilot whale biotelemetry data.},

@article{liNovelMachineLearning2020,
	abstract = {Actigraphy is widely used in sleep studies but lacks a universal unsupervised algorithm for sleep/wake identification. An unsupervised algorithm is useful in large-scale population studies and in cases where polysomnography (PSG) is unavailable, as it does not require sleep outcome labels to train the model but utilizes information solely contained in actigraphy to learn sleep and wake characteristics and separate the two states. In this study, we proposed a machine learning unsupervised algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for sleep/wake identification. The proposed algorithm is also an individualized approach that takes into account individual variabilities and analyzes each individual actigraphy profile separately to infer sleep and wake states. We used Actiwatch and PSG data from 43 individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis study to evaluate the method performance. Epoch-by-epoch comparisons and sleep variable comparisons were made between our algorithm, the unsupervised algorithm embedded in the Actiwatch software (AS), and the pre-trained supervised UCSD algorithm. Using PSG as the reference, the accuracy was 85.7\% for HMM, 84.7\% for AS, and 85.0\% for UCSD. The sensitivity was 99.3\%, 99.7\%, and 98.9\% for HMM, AS, and UCSD, respectively, and the specificity was 36.4\%, 30.0\%, and 31.7\%, respectively. The Kappa statistic was 0.446 for HMM, 0.399 for AS, and 0.311 for UCSD, suggesting fair to moderate agreement between PSG and actigraphy. The Bland--Altman plots further show that the total sleep time, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency estimates by HMM were closer to PSG with narrower 95\% limits of agreement than AS and UCSD. All three methods tend to overestimate sleep and underestimate wake compared to PSG. Our HMM approach is also able to differentiate relatively active and sedentary individuals by quantifying variabilities in activity counts: individuals with higher estimated activity variabilities tend to show more frequent sedentary behaviors. Our unsupervised data-driven HMM algorithm achieved better performance than the commonly used Actiwatch software algorithm and the pre-trained UCSD algorithm. HMM can help expand the application of actigraphy in cases where PSG is hard to acquire and supervised methods cannot be trained. In addition, the estimated HMM parameters can characterize individual activity patterns and sedentary tendencies that can be further utilized in downstream analysis.},

@article{imtiaz2021,
	abstract = {Designing wearable systems for sleep detection and staging is extremely challenging due to the numerous constraints associated with sensing, usability, accuracy, and regulatory requirements. Several researchers have explored the use of signals from a subset of sensors that are used in polysomnography (PSG), whereas others have demonstrated the feasibility of using alternative sensing modalities. In this paper, a systematic review of the different sensing modalities that have been used for wearable sleep staging is presented. Based on a review of 90 papers, 13 different sensing modalities are identified. Each sensing modality is explored to identify signals that can be obtained from it, the sleep stages that can be reliably identified, the classification accuracy of systems and methods using the sensing modality, as well as the usability constraints of the sensor in a wearable system. It concludes that the two most common sensing modalities in use are those based on electroencephalography (EEG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). EEG-based systems are the most accurate, with EEG being the only sensing modality capable of identifying all the stages of sleep. PPG-based systems are much simpler to use and better suited for wearable monitoring but are unable to identify all the sleep stages.},

@article{websterActivityBasedSleepMonitor1982,
	abstract = {Wrist activity measured with a piezoceramic transducer was digitized and analyzed together with subjects' sleep/wake status to derive an optimal method for automatic computer sleep/wake scoring. Several algorithms for quantifying periods of activity were considered, and an algorithm that summed changes in activity level over a 2-s interval was found most sensitive. A computer program for scoring sleep/wake from the resulting digital activity records was then developed, and parameters derived by comparison with subjects' sleep/wake status as determined by EEG. EEG and activity sleep/wake scores agreed 94.46\% of the time. A further prospective test of the automatic scoring system with new data yielded agreement of96.02\%. Finally, the data collection and recording functions were implemented in a wearable microprocessor-based digital activity monitor. The automatic scoring program was adjusted to use activity data collected by this monitor, and agreed 93.88\% with EEG scoring. A prospective test with new data agreed 93.04\% with EEG. Automatic scoring of activity data for sleep/wake is not only fast and accurate, but allows sleep to be monitored in non-laboratory situations. In addition, the score is objective and reliable, and free of scorer bias and drift.},

@article{Dinesh2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical behavior researchers using motion sensors often use acceleration summaries to visualize, clean, and interpret data. Such output is dependent on device specifications (e.g., dynamic range, sampling rate) and/or are proprietary, which invalidate cross-study comparison of findings when using different devices. This limits flexibility in selecting devices to measure physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. PURPOSE: Develop an open-source, universal acceleration summary metric that accounts for discrepancies in raw data among research and consumer devices. METHODS: We used signal processing techniques to generate a Monitor-Independent Movement Summary unit (MIMS-unit) optimized to capture normal human motion. Methodological steps included raw signal harmonization to eliminate inter-device variability (e.g., dynamic g-range, sampling rate), bandpass filtering (0.2-5.0 Hz) to eliminate non-human movement, and signal aggregation to reduce data to simplify visualization and summarization. We examined the consistency of MIMS-units using orbital shaker testing on eight accelerometers with varying dynamic range ($\pm$2 to $\pm$8 g) and sampling rates (20-100 Hz), and human data (N = 60) from an ActiGraph GT9X. RESULTS: During shaker testing, MIMS-units yielded lower between-device coefficient of variations than proprietary ActiGraph and ENMO acceleration summaries. Unlike the widely used ActiGraph activity counts, MIMS-units were sensitive in detecting subtle wrist movements during sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Open-source MIMS-units may provide a means to summarize high-resolution raw data in a device-independent manner, thereby increasing standardization of data cleaning and analytical procedures to estimate selected attributes of physical behavior across studies.},

@article{blumeNparACTPackageFree2016,
	abstract = {For many studies, participants' sleep-wake patterns are monitored and recorded prior to, during and following an experimental or clinical intervention using actigraphy, i.e. the recording of data generated by movements. Often, these data are merely inspected visually without computation of descriptive parameters, in part due to the lack of user-friendly software. To address this deficit, we developed a package for R Core Team [6], that allows computing several non-parametric measures from actigraphy data. Specifically, it computes the interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) of activity and gives the start times and average activity values of M10 (i.e. the ten hours with maximal activity) and L5 (i.e. the five hours with least activity). Two functions compute these 'classical' parameters and handle either single or multiple files. Two other functions additionally allow computing an L-value (i.e. the least activity value) for a user-defined time span termed 'Lflex' value. A plotting option is included in all functions. The package can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archives Network (CRAN). *The package 'nparACT' for R serves the non-parametric analysis of actigraphy data.*Computed parameters include interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV) and relative amplitude (RA) as well as start times and average activity during the 10~h with maximal and the 5~h with minimal activity (i.e. M10 and L5).},

In this study, we investigate seven common sleep-wake scoring algorithms designed for actigraphic data, namely Cole-Kripke algorithm, two versions of Sadeh algorithm, Sazonov algorithm, Webster algorithm, UCSD algorithm and Scripps Clinic algorithm. We propose a unified mathematical framework describing five of them. One of the observed novelties is that five of these algorithms are in fact equivalent to low-pass FIR filters with very similar characteristics. We also provide explanations about the role of some factors defining these algorithms, as none were given by their Authors who followed empirical procedures. Proposed framework provides a robust mathematical description of discussed algorithms, which for the first time allows one to fully understand their operation and basics.},

	abstract = {The NHANES study contains objectively measured physical activity data collected using hip-worn accelerometers from multiple cohorts. However, using the accelerometry data has proven daunting because: 1) currently, there are no agreed upon standard protocols for data storage and analysis; 2) data exhibit heterogeneous patterns of missingness due to varying degrees of adherence to wear-time protocols; 3) sampling weights need to be carefully adjusted and accounted for in individual analyses; 4) there is a lack of reproducible software that transforms the data from its published format into analytic form; and 5) the high dimensional nature of accelerometry data complicates analyses. Here, we provide a framework for processing, storing, and analyzing the NHANES accelerometry data for the 2003--2004 and 2005--2006 surveys. We also provide an NHANES data package in R, to help disseminate high quality, processed activity data combined with mortality and demographic information. Thus, we provide the tools to transition from ``available data online'' to ``easily accessible and usable data'', which substantially reduces the large upfront costs of initiating studies of association between physical activity and human health outcomes using NHANES. We apply these tools in an analysis showing that accelerometry features have the potential to predict 5-year all cause mortality better than known risk factors such as age, cigarette smoking, and various comorbidities.},

	abstract = {We compared performance of four popular interpretative algorithms (IAs), i.e., Cole-Kripke, Rescored Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and UCSD, utilized to derive sleep parameters from wrist actigraphy data. We conducted in-home sleep study of 40 healthy adults (17 female/23 male; age 26.7~$\pm$~12.1~years), assessing sleep variables both by Motionlogger{\textregistered} Micro Watch Actigraphy (MMWA) and Zmachine{\textregistered} Insight+ electroencephalography (EEG). Data of MMWA were separately scored per 30~sec epochs by each of the four popular IAs, and data of the Zmachine were also scored per 30~sec epochs by its proprietary IA. In reference to the EEG Zmachine method, all four of the MMWA algorithms showed high (\textasciitilde 94 to 98\%) sensitivity and moderate (\textasciitilde 42 to 54\%) specificity in detecting Sleep epochs. All of them significantly underestimated Sleep Onset Latency (SOL: \textasciitilde 9 to 20~min), and all of them, except the Sadeh IA, significantly underestimated Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO: \textasciitilde 22 to 25~min) and overestimated Total Sleep Time (TST: \textasciitilde 32 to 45~min) and Sleep Efficiency (SE: \textasciitilde 7 to 9\%). The Sadeh IA showed significantly smaller bias than the other three IAs in deriving WASO, TST, and SE. Overall, application of 'Rescoring Rules' improved performance of the Cole-Kripke IA. The Sadeh and Rescored Cole-Kripke IAs exhibited highest agreement with the EEG Zmachine method (Cohen's Kappa: \textasciitilde 51\%), while the UCSD IA exhibited lowest agreement (Cohen's kappa: \textasciitilde 47\%). However, minimum detectable change across all sleep parameters was smallest with use of the UCSD IA and, except for SOL, largest with use of the Sadeh algorithm. Findings of this study indicate the Sadeh IA is most appropriate for deriving sleep parameters of healthy adults, while the UCSD IA is most appropriate for evaluating change in sleep parameters over time or in response to medical intervention.},

@article{mantuaReliabilitySleepMeasures2016,
	abstract = {Polysomnography (PSG) is the ``gold standard'' for monitoring sleep. Alternatives to PSG are of interest for clinical, research, and personal use. Wrist-worn actigraph devices have been utilized in research settings for measures of sleep for over two decades. Whether sleep measures from commercially available devices are similarly valid is unknown. We sought to determine the validity of five wearable devices: Basis Health Tracker, Misfit Shine, Fitbit Flex, Withings Pulse O2, and a research-based actigraph, Actiwatch Spectrum. We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to assess differences between devices relative to PSG and correlational analysis to assess the strength of the relationship. Data loss was greatest for Fitbit and Misfit. For all devices, we found no difference and strong correlation of total sleep time with PSG. Sleep efficiency differed from PSG for Withings, Misfit, Fitbit, and Basis, while Actiwatch mean values did not differ from that of PSG. Only mean values of sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) from Actiwatch correlated with PSG, yet this correlation was weak. Light sleep time differed from PSG (nREM1 + nREM2) for all devices. Measures of Deep sleep time did not differ from PSG (SWS + REM) for Basis. These results reveal the current strengths and limitations in sleep estimates produced by personal health monitoring devices and point to a need for future development.},

@article{gaoDilemmaAnalyzingPhysical2021,
	abstract = {Physical behaviors (e.g., physical activity and sedentary behavior) have been the focus among many researchers in the biomedical and behavioral science fields. The recent shift from hip- to wrist-worn accelerometers in these fields has signaled the need to develop novel approaches to process raw acceleration data of physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the best practices for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data to accurately predict individuals' energy expenditure and the times spent in different intensities of free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior. To this end, accurately analyzing and interpreting wrist-worn accelerometer data has become a major challenge facing many clinicians and researchers. In response, this paper attempts to review different methodologies for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data and offer cutting edge, yet appropriate analysis plans for wrist-worn accelerometer data in the assessment of physical behavior. In this paper, we first discuss the fundamentals of wrist-worn accelerometer data, followed by various methods of processing these data (e.g., cut points, steps per minute, machine learning), and then we discuss the opportunities, challenges, and directions for future studies in this area of inquiry. This is the most comprehensive review paper to date regarding the analysis and interpretation of free-living physical activity data derived from wrist-worn accelerometers, aiming to help establish a blueprint for processing wrist-derived accelerometer data.},

@article{ancoli-israelRoleActigraphyStudy2003,
	abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

@article{liuWearableDeviceHeart2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proliferation of wearable devices that collect activity and heart rate data has facilitated new ways to measure sleeping and waking durations unobtrusively and longitudinally. Most existing sleep/wake identification algorithms are based on activity only and are trained on expensive and laboriously annotated polysomnography (PSG). Heart rate can also be reflective of sleep/wake transitions, which has motivated its investigation herein in an unsupervised algorithm. Moreover, it is necessary to develop a personalized approach to deal with interindividual variance in sleep/wake patterns. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an unsupervised personalized sleep/wake identification algorithm using multifaceted data to explore the benefits of incorporating both heart rate and activity level in these types of algorithms and to compare this approach's output with that of an existing commercial wearable device's algorithms. METHODS: In this study, a total of 14 community-dwelling older adults wore wearable devices (Fitbit Alta; Fitbit Inc) 24 hours a day and 7 days a week over period of 3 months during which their heart rate and activity data were collected. After preprocessing the data, a model was developed to distinguish sleep/wake states based on each individual's data. We proposed the use of hidden Markov models and compared different modeling schemes. With the best model selected, sleep/wake patterns were characterized by estimated parameters in hidden Markov models, and sleep/wake states were identified. RESULTS: When applying our proposed algorithm on a daily basis, we found there were significant differences in estimated parameters between weekday models and weekend models for some participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our unsupervised approach can be effectively implemented based on an individual's multifaceted sleep-related data from a commercial wearable device. A personalized model is shown to be necessary given the interindividual variability in estimated parameters.},

@article{potterCircadianRhythmSleep2016,
	abstract = {Abstract             Circadian (∼24-hour) timing systems pervade all kingdoms of life and temporally optimize behavior and physiology in humans. Relatively recent changes to our environments, such as the introduction of artificial lighting, can disorganize the circadian system, from the level of the molecular clocks that regulate the timing of cellular activities to the level of synchronization between our daily cycles of behavior and the solar day. Sleep/wake cycles are intertwined with the circadian system, and global trends indicate that these, too, are increasingly subject to disruption. A large proportion of the world's population is at increased risk of environmentally driven circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, and a minority of individuals are also genetically predisposed to circadian misalignment and sleep disorders. The consequences of disruption to the circadian system and sleep are profound and include myriad metabolic ramifications, some of which may be compounded by adverse effects on dietary choices. If not addressed, the deleterious effects of such disruption will continue to cause widespread health problems; therefore, implementation of the numerous behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions that can help restore circadian system alignment and enhance sleep will be important.},
